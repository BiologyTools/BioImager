# host is the IP address (or hostname) from where the device will be
# accessible.  If everything is on the same computer, then host will
# be '127.0.0.1'.  If devices are to be available on the network,
# then it will be the IP address on that network.

# Each element in the DEVICES list identifies a device that will be
# served on the network.  Each device is defined like so:
#
# device(cls, host, port, conf)
#     cls: class of the device that will be served
#     host: ip or hostname where the device will be accessible.
#         This will be the same value for all devices.
#     port: port number where the device will be accessible.
#         Each device must have its own port.
#     conf: a dict with the arguments to construct the device
#         instance.  See the individual class documentation.
